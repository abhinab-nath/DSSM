STEP 1: Selection of Dataset
We selected a Phishing Dataset from UCI ML repo for our porject.
The dataset was orginally available in ARFF which is not suitable for many python libraries,
so we first converted it into CSV file format for easier handling and analysis.

----

STEP 2: Data loading and understanding
After converting the datset, we loaded it into python using data analysis tools.
And we started by observing: 
    -the shape of dataset(no. of rows, columns)
    -the names of all features(columns)
    -the types of data in each column(numerical, categorical, etc)
This step helped us get a clear idea about the structure and composition of our dataset.

----

STEP 3: Data summary and description
We generated a summary report of the dataset to understand it better.
This include: 
    -basic statistics like mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation.
    -count of missing values in each column
    -class distribution of the targated variable( which indiactes if a website is phishing or legitimate).
    -correaltion analysis between different features to see how strongly they are related.
This summary gave us an overall view of data quality, balance, and relationships between variables.

----

STEP 4: Data Visulization
We performed several types of visual analysis to understand the data patterns more clearly.
Some of the main Visulization we created include:
    1.Histograms: to study the distribution of each numeric feature and see if the data is normally distributed or skewed.
    2.BoxPlots: to detect the presence of outliers and compare the spread of data across features.
    3.CountPlots: to visualize the frequency of each category in categorical column.
    4.PairPlots: to observe pairwise relationships and patterns between numerical variable.
    5.Correaltion Heatmap: to identify features that are highly correlated with each other.
Allt these plots helped in identifying useful insights about the dataset and detetecting any irregularities or patterns.

----

STEP 5: Observation from analysis
From decriptive and visual analysis, we could identify:
    -which features were most correalted with the target result.
    -whether any columns had missing or unusual values.
    -the balance between phishing and non-phishing classes.
    -possible outliers or features that might need transformation before modeling.
These finding are useful for data processing in later stages.

STEP 6: Outcome so far
Till now we have,
    -sucessfully converted and explored the dataset.
    -generated a complete descriptive summary.
    -visualized data patterns.
    -identified potential next steps for model building and evaluation.
This completes the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase of our subject, which forms foundation of all further modelling.
